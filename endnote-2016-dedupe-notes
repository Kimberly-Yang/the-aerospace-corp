	In the rubidium atomic frequency standard (RAFS), an rf-discharge lamp produces the device's atomic signal. As a consequence of the light-shift effect, variations in the lamplight's intensity result in variations in the RAFS' output frequency. While the basic physics of the light-shift is reasonably well understood, its operational implications for GNSS performance are only beginning to be fully appreciated. Here, we summarize results examining decade-long histories of on-orbit GPS RAFS lamplight variations. In addition to a deterministic variation that is well modeled by the sum of an exponential and linear trend, the stochastic variations appear to be of three types: lamplight jumps, repeating lamplight ramps, and non-stationary lamplight noise. Employing an estimated GPS RAFS light-shift coefficient, these variations can be used to infer lamplight-induced RAFS frequency variations.

	The frequency of the Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard (RAFS) used in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is affected by the light-shift effect, due to the opticalpumping light from the RAFS' rf-discharge lamp. As a consequence, lamplight intensity variations can induce RAFS output frequency variations, with lamplight stability setting a lower bound to RAFS frequency stability (i.e., to the eventual navigation performance of the GNSS). We study this effect by estimating the light-shift coefficient of an on-orbit RAFS and its possible variation in time using two different methods: the first makes use of large observed frequency jumps that are induced by lamplight jumps; the second uses the linear correlation between deterministic frequency and lamplight variations. We validate the methodology using GPS Block IIR RAFS data and present some preliminary results. Â© 2016 IEEE.
