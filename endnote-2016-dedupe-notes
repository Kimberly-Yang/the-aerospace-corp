BOOK: Camparo, J., et al. (2016). Characterization & Consequences of GPS Rb Clock Lamplight Variations. 2016 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium. New York, Ieee: 157-160.
	In the rubidium atomic frequency standard (RAFS), an rf-discharge lamp produces the device's atomic signal. As a consequence of the light-shift effect, variations in the lamplight's intensity result in variations in the RAFS' output frequency. While the basic physics of the light-shift is reasonably well understood, its operational implications for GNSS performance are only beginning to be fully appreciated. Here, we summarize results examining decade-long histories of on-orbit GPS RAFS lamplight variations. In addition to a deterministic variation that is well modeled by the sum of an exponential and linear trend, the stochastic variations appear to be of three types: lamplight jumps, repeating lamplight ramps, and non-stationary lamplight noise. Employing an estimated GPS RAFS light-shift coefficient, these variations can be used to infer lamplight-induced RAFS frequency variations.
